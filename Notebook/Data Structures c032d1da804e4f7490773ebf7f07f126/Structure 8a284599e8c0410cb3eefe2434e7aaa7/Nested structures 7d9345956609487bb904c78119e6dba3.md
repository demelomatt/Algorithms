# Nested structures

You can create structures within a structure in C programming. For example,

```c
struct complex
{
 int imag;
 float real;
};

struct number
{
   struct complex comp;
   int integers;
} num1, num2;

```

Suppose, you want to set imag of num2 variable to 11. Here's how you can do it:

```c
num2.comp.imag = 11;
```
