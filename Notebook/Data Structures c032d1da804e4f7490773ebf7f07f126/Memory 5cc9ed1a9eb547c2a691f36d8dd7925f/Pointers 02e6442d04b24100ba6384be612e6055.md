# Pointers

A variable that stores an address is called a **pointer**, which we can think of as a value that “points” to a location in memory. In C, pointers can refer to specific types of values.

We can use the ***** operator to declare a variable that we want to be a pointer.

### **Pointer Syntax**

Here is how we can declare pointers.

```c
int* p;
```

Here, we have declared a pointer **p** of `int` type.

You can also declare pointers in these ways.

```c
int *p1;
int * p2;
```

Let's take another example of declaring pointers:

```c
int* p1, p2;
```

Here, we have declared a pointer p1 and a normal variable p2.

### Example:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main(void)
{
   int n = 50;
   int *p = &n;
   printf("%p\n", p);
}
```

- Here, we use `int *p` to declare a variable, `p`, that has the type of *****, a pointer, to a value of type`int`, an integer. Then, we can print its value (an address, something like `0x12345678`), or print the *value at* its location with `printf("%i\n", *p);`.

### **Assigning addresses to Pointers**

Let's take an example.

```c
int *pc, c;
c = 5;
pc = &c;
```

Here, 5 is assigned to the **c** variable. And, the address of **c** is assigned to the **pc** pointer.

### **Get Value of Thing Pointed by Pointers**

To get the value of the thing pointed by the pointers, we use the `*` operator. For example:

```c
int* pc, c;
c = 5;
pc = &c;
printf("%d", *pc);   // Output: 5
```

Here, the address of `c` is assigned to the pc pointer. To get the value stored in that address, we used *pc.

Note: In the above example, pc is a pointer, not *pc. You cannot and should not do something like *pc = &c;

### Changing Value Pointed by Pointers

Example 1:

```c
int* pc, c;
c = 5;
pc = &c;
c = 1;
printf("%d", c);    // Output: 1
printf("%d", *pc);  // Ouptut: 1
```

We have assigned the address of **c** to the **pc** pointer.

Then, we changed the value of **c** to 1. Since **pc** and the address of **c** is the same, `*pc` gives us 1.

Example 2:

```c
int* pc, c;
c = 5;
pc = &c;
*pc = 1;
printf("%d", *pc);  // Ouptut: 1
printf("%d", c);    // Output: 1
```

We have assigned the address of **c** to the **pc** pointer.

Then, we changed `*pc` to 1 using `*pc = 1;`. Since **pc** and the address of **c** is the same, **c** will be equal to 1.

## **Common mistakes when working with pointers**

Suppose, you want pointer **pc** to point to the address of **c**. Then,

```c
int c, *pc;

// pc is address but c is not
pc = c; // Error

// &c is address but *pc is not
*pc = &c; // Error

// both &c and pc are addresses
pc = &c;

// both c and *pc values 
*pc = c;
```

Here's an example of pointer syntax beginners often find confusing.

```c
#include <stdio.h>
int main() {
   int c = 5;
   int *p = &c;

   printf("%d", *p);  // 5
   return 0; 
}
```

**Why didn't we get an error when using `int *p = &c;`?**

It's because

```c
int *p = &c;
```

is equivalent to

```c
int *p:
p = &c;
```

In both cases, we are creating a pointer `p` (not `*p`) and assigning `&c` to it.

To avoid this confusion, we can use the statement like this:

```c
int* p = &c;
```

## Abstraction

In our computer’s memory, the variables will look like this:

Since `p` is a variable itself, it’s somewhere in memory, and the value stored there is the address of `n`.

Modern computer systems are “64-bit”, meaning that they use 64 bits to address memory, so a pointer will in reality be 8 bytes, twice as big as an integer of 4 bytes.

We can abstract away the actual value of the addresses, since they’ll be different as we declare variables in our programs and not very useful, and simply think of **p** as “pointing at” some value:
