# Addresses

We might create a value `n`, and print it out:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main(void)
{
    int n = 50;
    printf("%i\n", n);
}
```

In our computer’s memory, there are now 4 bytes somewhere that have the binary value of 50, labeled `n`

It turns out that, with the billions of bytes in memory, those bytes for the variable **n** starts at some location, which might look something like 0x12345678 (Hexadecimal)

In C, we can actually see the address with the & operator, which means “get the address of this variable”.

We have used address numerous times while using the `scanf()` function.

```c
scanf("%d", &var);
```

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main(void)
{
    int n;
		printf("Enter a value: ");
		scanf("%d", &n);
    printf("%p\n", &n);
}
```

- `%p` is the format code for an address.
- The ***** operator, or the dereference operator, lets us “go to” the location that a pointer is pointing to.
- For example, we can print `&n`, where we “go to” the address of `n`, and that will print out the value of `n`, since that’s the value at the address of `n`:

    ```c
    #include <stdio.h>

    int main(void)
    {
        int n;
    		printf("Enter a value: ");
    		scanf("%d", &n);
        printf("%d\n", *&n);
    }
    ```
